As such, HerpMapper Partners are discouraged from sharing point-location data publicly, even for common species, but HerpMapper acknowledges that in some cases this may be necessary to meet conservation and research objectives. HerpMapper encourages Partners to contact HerpMapper directly to discuss publication and sharing of these data to meet your needs while also best protecting herpetofauna populations. This also ensures that multiple organizations do not attempt to publish the same new and updated county records in Herpetological Review geographical distribution notes.","","4"
